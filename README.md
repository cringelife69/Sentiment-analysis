Sentiment Analysis Project Overview The Sentiment Analysis project is a natural language processing (NLP) tool that uses machine learning to analyze and classify the sentiment expressed in text data. It can identify whether a given piece of text (e.g., product reviews, social media posts, or feedback) carries a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. This project leverages various NLP techniques and machine learning models like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and deep learning-based approaches to predict sentiment accurately. It can be easily integrated into applications for real-time sentiment analysis, customer feedback analysis, or social media monitoring.

Key Features Text Preprocessing:

Cleans and processes raw text data (tokenization, removing stopwords, stemming, and lemmatization). Multiple Models:

Implements multiple machine learning models (Naive Bayes, SVM) and deep learning models (LSTM, BERT) for sentiment classification. Sentiment Classification:

Classifies text into three primary categories: Positive, Negative, and Neutral sentiments. Real-time Analysis:

Can analyze and classify the sentiment of real-time data streams, such as live social media posts or customer feedback. Visualization:

Provides graphical representations of sentiment distribution, helping to analyze trends over time. Multilingual Support:

Capable of handling text in multiple languages, with models trained on multilingual datasets for broader applicability. Accuracy Metrics:

Evaluates model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics to ensure high-quality predictions. Customizable:

Allows users to add custom datasets and train new models to suit specific domains or industries (e.g., finance, healthcare). Pre-trained Models:

Includes pre-trained models that are ready to use, allowing for quick deployment without requiring extensive training. Easy Integration:

Easy to integrate into existing web applications, customer service bots, and other platforms through APIs or direct library usage. Technologies Used Programming Language: Python Libraries: NLTK, spaCy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, Hugging Face Transformers Modeling Techniques: Naive Bayes, SVM, LSTM, BERT Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly Installation Guide Clone the Repository:
